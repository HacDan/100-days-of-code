# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 23rd, 2022
I didn't realize I couldn't work through coursework. I'm going to run two logs being as this is the case.

#### Coursework
Completed Dice Roller app from the Android Kotlin Course. More towards the point of this exercise, I did write the majority of the code from previous knowledge of Android development, instead of following the tutorial.

Also created the Debugging app to learn a bit of logging. Again, not much has changed since I did Android development almost 12 years ago. Nice to see Kotlin is an easy transition from someone who originally learned Java.

### Day 2: June 24th, 2022

#### Coursework
Started and completed the Lemonade squeeze app.

### Day 3: June 25th, 2022

#### Coursework
Began implementing the Tip Calculator app. Did not follow tutorial except for layout for more in the spirit of this challenge.

I do want to point out that I understand the point of this challenge is to actually write code as opposed to write tutorials, but I started this challenge to get back into Android development, specifically in Kotlin as I've never worked with it before 3 days ago.

Overall, I'm having a blast working with Android again. Constraint layout makes this 100 times easier. I do fear, though, that learning Constraint layout may be a waste of time due to Jetpack Compose. Only time will tell.
