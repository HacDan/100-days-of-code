# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 23rd, 2022
I didn't realize I couldn't work through coursework. I'm going to run two logs being as this is the case.

#### Coursework
Completed Dice Roller app from the Android Kotlin Course. More towards the point of this exercise, I did write the majority of the code from previous knowledge of Android development, instead of following the tutorial.

Also created the Debugging app to learn a bit of logging. Again, not much has changed since I did Android development almost 12 years ago. Nice to see Kotlin is an easy transition from someone who originally learned Java.

### Day 2: June 24th, 2022

#### Coursework
Started and completed the Lemonade squeeze app.

### Day 3: June 25th, 2022

#### Coursework
Began implementing the Tip Calculator app. Did not follow tutorial except for layout for more in the spirit of this challenge.

I do want to point out that I understand the point of this challenge is to actually write code as opposed to write tutorials, but I started this challenge to get back into Android development, specifically in Kotlin as I've never worked with it before 3 days ago.

Overall, I'm having a blast working with Android again. Constraint layout makes this 100 times easier. I do fear, though, that learning Constraint layout may be a waste of time due to Jetpack Compose. Only time will tell.

### Day 4: June 26th, 2022

#### Coursework
Updated Tip Calculator app to use String Format. Apparnently Kotlin has some currency formatting built in that I will probably conver to.

Also implemented displaying the total in the app along wiht rounding the tip up to the next dollar.

Read a bit about view binding. Planning on implementing that tomorrow instead of the old FindViewById method.

### Day 5.1: June 27(8)th, 2022

#### Coursework
Today's a bit late. Late night at work, but I still got my hour in, just not all before the time flipped over on the east coast. I didn't feel like traveling west just to fix this, I think in the spirit of things, I'm well within bounds. I haven't gone to bed yet, so we're good.

Anyway, updated TipCalculator to use String resources instead of hardcoded values. Updated ID's to snake_case to work with modern convention. I also updated some of the business logic to be a bit safer when calling, while also implementing some DRY principals on error checking. More work to do in this area, but it's just a portfolio app from a tut, so, maybe not?

All in all, a productive day considering everything else going on. I'm committed to not missing a day, even if it means stretching the rules to better meet the spirit of the challenge.

EDIT: I did want to add, that I'm planning on implementing logging tomorrow night along with converting to view bindings as that's what's the cool kids are doing now. Ran out of time tonight. Must sleep!
### Day 6: June 28th, 2022

#### Coursework
So... today is again the 28th, as was the last commit, but I'd say I'm still in the clear. I stand by my reasoning. I did sleep in between.

Anyway, worked on theming today. Also implemented View Bindings instead of findViewById (Which is what I learned 10+ years ago...) The times they are a changin' as they say. I mean, when I first learned Android Dev it was done in a completely different language which I actually despise... Getters and Setters just aren't for me, what can I say?

Tomorrow I'm planning on implementing a horizontal layout and some testing. That should be it for this "App". I am working through the coursework as well, but I'm making sure to spend an hour on this "App" if that's what you want to call it outside of that coursework, just to make sure I' mstaying within the spirit of this challenge.

Probably going to write a blogpost tomorrow on this challenge along with my progress so far with refreshing my Android knowledge. We'll see.
