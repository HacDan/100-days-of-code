# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 23rd, 2022
I didn't realize I couldn't work through coursework. I'm going to run two logs being as this is the case.

#### Coursework
Completed Dice Roller app from the Android Kotlin Course. More towards the point of this exercise, I did write the majority of the code from previous knowledge of Android development, instead of following the tutorial.

Also created the Debugging app to learn a bit of logging. Again, not much has changed since I did Android development almost 12 years ago. Nice to see Kotlin is an easy transition from someone who originally learned Java.
